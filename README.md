### Hi!

I'm Brice and I'm a software engineer for more than a year. I've been working on Ruby On Rails, Javascript and now React.
I learned how to use and I use frequently haml, Alpine.js, Tailwind and Hotwire.

⚛️ Currently learning React (the Epic React course by Kent. C. Dodds is incredible)

🎮 Currently working on a basic gaming backlog tracker with React and Rails, using the react-rails gem and the RAWG api (DONE, now I guess I can add React to my resume)
