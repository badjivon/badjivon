### Hi!

I'm Brice and I'm a software engineer for more than a year. I've been working on Ruby On Rails, Javascript and now React.
I learned how to use and I use frequently haml, Alpine.js, Tailwind and Hotwire.

I am currently working at Ville de Paris, which is probably the frenchiest job I could find after testing some US Startups.

🎮 Currently working on a basic gaming backlog tracker with React and Rails, using the react-rails gem and the RAWG api (DONE, now I guess I can add React to my resume)
